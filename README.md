# Responsive Portfolio
The purpose of this project was to create a responsive porfolio page using CSS Bootstrap. The aim was to ensure that the layout and styling was consistent across all pages regardless of the viewport/screen size.

## First steps: Navbar and Footer
**Navbar**: I initially started with adding a navbar for each site. I opted for putting the navbar within the header tag as I had difficulties with expanding the width within the body of the page. Later on during the project, a toggler was embedded added with links to the other pages.

**Footer**: When I originally made this porfolio weppage, I had trouble with creating a sticky footer. However now that I have had more experience with HTML and CSS, I was able to stick the footer to the bottom of the page. 

## Second steps: Body and content 
The [My Porfolio](https://karen-o94.github.io/responsive-portfolio/index.html): The 'img-thumbnail' class was used to give the image more depth and a 'float' was used to keep the image in-line with the text.

The [Contact Page](https://karen-o94.github.io/responsive-portfolio/contact.html): Built with form element using Boostrap all contained within one column

The [Portfolio](https://karen-o94.github.io/responsive-portfolio/portfolio.html): Built with a series of 3 rows and 2 columns to hold images. The size of images was determined based on the size of the container to avoid images exceeding the container when screensize was reduced. Unfortunately I was not able to reduce the spacing within the 2 columns on a desktop screen but this spacing was eliminated as screen size was minimised.

## Final Steps & Conclusion:
Tidying up formatting, including semantic tags and improving the overall styling of page.
